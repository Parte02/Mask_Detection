# Mask Detection System

This repository contains the code for a mask detection system using deep learning techniques. The system is capable of detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not in images or live video streams.

## Features

- **Mask Detection**: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
- **Image and Video Support**: Supports both image and live video input for real-time detection.
- **Accuracy**: The model has been trained on a large dataset and achieves high accuracy in mask detection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parte02/Mask_Detection.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights (add instructions if necessary).

## Usage

- For image detection, run:

```bash
python detect_image.py --image <path_to_image>
```

- For live video stream detection, run:

```bash
python detect_video.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or find any issues, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Acknowledgments

- The deep learning model used in this project is based on the work of [insert_name_here].
